## üöÄ Current Scripts

### 1. Patroni Leader & Replication Monitor (`patroni_leader_monitor.sh`)
This Bash script monitors a Patroni PostgreSQL cluster for:
- **Leader changes** (detects and logs when a new leader is elected).
- **Leader status changes** (e.g., `running` ‚Üí `stopped`).
- **Replica replication lag** (alerts if replicas fall behind the leader).
- **Automated alerts** (via `sendSMS.pl` or `sendSMSLEADER.pl`).

It maintains log files and text messages for integration with external notification systems.
